### What is this?
A fun game for Nat! I had not heard of this game before.

### Known issues
* Only one game is possible at a time, so don't tell anyone this is here
* We don't kick users off the server on socket disconnect, which ain't good
* If the moderator goes AFK everything will pretty much grind to a halt
* No handling for running out of cards mid-game
* I think excess cards will get carried over to the next game
* The styling is hilariously bad
* I probably missed some things. File an issue!

### Deployment
* Currently up at https://round-brave-davidstiger.gigalixirapp.com/
